# LocalFileServer
  This is a local fileserver for user to transport files in different devices. It offers upload file and download file server.
  The setting of data warehouse is in ``get_file_data.py``. 
  If you need ipv6 support, change into ``app.run(host="::")`` in ``app.py``. 
  For now, it dose not support to open subfold. Maybe add this later.
